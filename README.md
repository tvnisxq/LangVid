# LangVid 🎬

**Turn any video or meeting recording into a transcript, summary, action items, and a chat partner — powered by LLMs and RAG.**

LangVid ingests a YouTube link or local audio/video file, transcribes it, and runs it through a pipeline that extracts a title, summary, action items, key decisions, and open questions. The full transcript is also indexed into a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chain so you can ask follow-up questions and get answers grounded in what was actually said.

The project ships with three ways to use it:
- A **CLI** (`main.py`) for quick, scriptable runs
- A **Streamlit UI** (`app.py`) for a fast, no-build interactive interface
- A **React frontend + FastAPI backend** (`frontend/` + `api/`) for a fully custom, production-style web app

## ✨ Features

- 🎧 **Flexible input** — YouTube URLs or local audio/video files
- 📝 **Transcription** — supports English and Hinglish
- 🏷️ **Auto-generated titles** for each session
- 📋 **Summarization** of the full conversation
- ✅ **Action item extraction**
- 🔑 **Key decision extraction**
- ❓ **Open question extraction**
- 💬 **Chat with your transcript** via a RAG-powered Q&A engine
- 🖥️ **Three interfaces**: CLI, Streamlit, and a React + FastAPI web app

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (only needed for the React frontend)
- API keys for whichever LLM/transcription providers `core/` is configured to use (set in `.env`)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and set up the Python environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd LANGVID
python -m venv langvid_venv
source langvid_venv/bin/activate   # Windows: langvid_venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the keys your `core/` modules expect, e.g.:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# add any other provider keys used by transcriber.py / summarizer.py / rag_engine.py
```

### 3. Run it — pick an interface

**Option A — CLI**

```bash
python main.py
```
You'll be prompted for a YouTube URL or file path, then a language. Once the pipeline finishes, you can chat with the transcript directly in the terminal.

**Option B — Streamlit UI**

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the local URL Streamlit prints (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

**Option C — React frontend + FastAPI backend**

Backend:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend (in a separate terminal):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **`process_input(source)`** — pulls audio from a YouTube URL or local file and splits it into chunks.
2. **`transcribe_all(chunks, language)`** — transcribes each chunk and stitches together the full transcript.
3. **`generate_title` / `summarize`** — produce a session title and summary from the transcript.
4. **`extract_action_items` / `extract_key_decisions` / `extract_questions`** — pull structured insights out of the transcript.
5. **`build_rag_chain(transcript)`** — embeds the transcript into a vector store for retrieval.
6. **`ask_question(rag_chain, question)`** — answers follow-up questions grounded in the transcript via retrieval-augmented generation.

The CLI, Streamlit app, and FastAPI backend are all thin wrappers around this same pipeline — none of them duplicate the core logic.

## 🖼️ Web App (React)

The React frontend talks to the FastAPI backend over two endpoints:

| Endpoint   | Method | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `/analyse` | POST   | Runs the full pipeline on a source and returns the title, transcript, summary, and extracted insights, plus a `session_id` |
| `/chat`    | POST   | Accepts a `session_id` and `question`, returns an answer grounded in that session's transcript |

Sessions are currently kept in memory on the backend — restarting the server clears them. For multi-user or production use, swap the in-memory store in `api/server.py` for Redis or a database.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] Multipart file upload endpoint (currently file input assumes a server-accessible path)
- [ ] Streaming/SSE pipeline progress instead of a single blocking request
- [ ] Persistent session store (Redis/DB) for multi-user deployments
- [ ] Support for additional languages beyond English/Hinglish
- [ ] Authentication for the API layer
